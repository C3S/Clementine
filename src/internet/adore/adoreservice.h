/// \mainpage Adore Developer Documentation Start Page
///
/// \section intro_sec Introduction
///
/// In the IMP project specification it was planned to implement an
/// audio fingerprinting algorithm into a popular music player to allow
/// for a unbribable music identification independently from possibly
/// stored metadata. The fingerprints had to be submitted to the backend
/// server without any user interaction being necessary.
///
/// From all music players we tested as candidates for implementing the
/// Adore prototype, *Clementine* stood out with respect to OS coverage,
/// stability, feature richness, code maintain- and exdendability, and
/// of course a cool user interface.
///
/// \section install_sec Installation
///
/// To provide an easier way to get to a debugging environment, two
/// alternatives exist:
/// * a shell script for Debian/Ubuntu and
/// * a Virtual Box image based on Lubuntu
///
/// \subsection shellscript_subsec Shellscript
///
/// The script is suitable to install everything necessary from scratch
/// on a freshly installed Ubuntu.
///
///
///     wget http://files.c3s.cc/setup_qt_and_clementine.sh
///     chmod 700 setup_qt_and_clementine.sh
///     ./setup_qt_and_clementine.sh
///
/// In case of a not quite so virgin system it is recommended to first
/// take a look on the script and make changes if necessary.
///
/// \subsection virtualboximage_subsec VirtualBox Image
///
/// The tarball (3,5 GB) includes a VM with the directory name Lubuntu32
/// (unzipped nearly 10GB):
///
///     cd "~/VirtualBox VMs"
///     wget http://files.c3s.cc/Lubuntu32.tgz
///     tar -xzf Lubuntu32.tgz
///     rm Lubuntu32.tgz
///     vitualbox
///
/// \section debuggingsettings_sec Debugging Settings of the Clementine Mods
///
/// To allow access to arbitrary test installations of the REST API and web
/// frontend, it is possible to override the hard-coded urls
/// https://restapitest.c3s.cc:443 and https://betatest.c3s.cc:443
/// in the Clementine.conf (subdirectory ~/.config/Clementine) using the
/// keys `webhost`, `webport`, `apihost`, and `apiport`:
///
///     [Adore]
///     webhost=http://localhost
///     webport=6543
///     apihost=http://localhost
///     apiport=6543
///     token=40a1b0d8-1f10-4490-b4b2-04743c61d3ea
///
/// \section systemrequirements_sec System Requirements
///
/// For optimal performance a main memory of at least 4GB is recommended.
/// On multi-core systems provide make with the parameter -jX (where X is
/// the number of processor cores). Find the make settings on the Projects
/// section of QtCreator's navi bar.
///
/// \section theardorecode_sec The Adore Code
///
/// You will find everything essential in the src/internet/adore folder.
/// Namely the classes AdoreService, AdoreDb, AdoreStreamer, and AdoreSettingsPage.
/// The EchoPrint code generator was put in the src/echoprint folder.
/// Other than this, only minor changes have been made to other files:
/// * CMakeLists.txt (to acutally add the .h & .cpp files to the project),
/// * to src/core/application.*,
/// * to src/core/player.*,
/// * to src/ui/settingsdialog.*,
/// * to data/data.qrc (to add the icon to the ressources), and
/// * added data/provider/adore.png (the actual icon image)
///
/// In order to take off quickly and get into the framework Clementine provides
/// for internet services, we cannibalized the lastfm code, so don't be surprised
/// if you stumble upon remains of the lastfm scrobbler service. In the future,
/// when the demands are more clear, we might implement an own base class for
/// seamless user interface integration from it.
///
/// To start exploring the source code, we recommend to first take a peek in AdoreService.
///

/*! To store track metadata the Track class was incorporated from from lastfm.
  * Here is the original comment:
  * Our track type. It's quite good, you may want to use it as your track type
  * in general. It is explicitly shared. Which means when you make a copy, they
  * both point to the same data still. This is like Qt's implicitly shared
  * classes, eg. QString, however if you mod a copy of a QString, the copy
  * detaches first, so then you have two copies. Our Track object doesn't
  * detach, which is very handy for our usage in the client, but perhaps not
  * what you want. If you need a deep copy for eg. work in a thread, call
  * clone(). */
